=======================================================================================

This will generate a comparison between two versions of the same
library. You need to move the libraries to the inputFiles/lastRelease
and inputFiles/currentRelease in order to submit directly, or you can
select folders/libraries to compare:

If there are any changes in the number of use cases, threats, weaknesses
or countermeasures a comparison between both versions will appear side
to side:

If you click on the "OK" button another window will appear:

Here you’ll be able to see an HTML report with the differences between
the involved libraries:
