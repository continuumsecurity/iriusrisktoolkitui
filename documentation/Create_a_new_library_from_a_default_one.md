IriusRisk Toolkit UI : Create a new library from a default one
===================================================================    

Launch IriusRiskToolkitUI by executing the following command:    

``` 
python IriusRiskToolKitUI.py
```    

This will open a GUI. Among them is the option "Create a new library from a default one":

This option will generate a new XML library using the same components as the default library you indicate. For that to work we need the following information:
* Base library: IriusRisk library to be the base of the new library
* Library filename: name of the file that will be generated
* Library name: official name of the library
* Library ref: reference name of the library (unique identifier)

Also we need you to check if you prefer ASVS3 countermeasures instead of ASVS4.

We made a special article in our helpdesk to clarify all this process:
